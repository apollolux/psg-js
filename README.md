# Preamble

This repository contains emulation of various programmable sound generator (PSG) chips written entirely in JavaScript. What sets apart these PSGs from other classes of PSGs is the level of the maths involved in the generation. They go here rather than elsewhere because the most common usage is generating square waves and/or noise.
